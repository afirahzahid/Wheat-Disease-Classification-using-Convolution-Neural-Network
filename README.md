# Wheat Disease Classification using Convolution Neural Network
1. Images data resizing and pre-processing using normalization.
2. Used Data Generators that loaded batches of data from disk into memory and passed into our convolution neural network model.
3. Training and evaluation of network for wheat disease classification.
